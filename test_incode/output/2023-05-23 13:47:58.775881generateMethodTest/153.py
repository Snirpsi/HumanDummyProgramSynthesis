Thanks for the answer, but I'm still getting a connection refused error. I've tried both with and without `bind` as you suggested, but still no luck. I've also tried `server.bind(("", ports[0]))` instead of `server.bind(("", 0))`, but still no luck. I've also tried `server.bind(("", 0))` instead of `server.bind(("", ports[0]))`, but still no luck. I've also tried `server.bind(("", 0))` instead of `server.bind(("", ports[0]))`, but still no luck. I've also tried `server.bind(("", 0))` instead of `server.bind(("", ports[0]))`, but still no luck. I've also tried `server.bind(("", 0))` instead of `server.bind(("", ports[0]))`, but still no luck. I've also tried `server.bind(("", 0))` instead of `server.bind(("", ports[0]))`, but still no luck.
