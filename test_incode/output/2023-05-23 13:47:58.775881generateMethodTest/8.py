The `if __name__ == '__main__'` line is necessary because `HTTPServer` will serve the file only if the file name is `__main__`. The `if __name__ == '__main__'` line is necessary because `HTTPServer` will serve the file only if the file name is `__main__`. The `if __name__ == '__main__'` line is necessary because `HTTPServer` will serve the file only if the file name is `__main__`.
