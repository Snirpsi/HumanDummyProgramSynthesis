Thanks for your answer. Can you please explain me what does this line do? `fruits_multiplied.append(fruit*2)`
<|/ c |>
<| c |>
It multiplies the fruits by 2, so instead of `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']` it becomes `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] * 2`

I got one more question. Can you please explain me what does this line do? `fruits_multiplied.append(fruit*2)`

The list comprehension will iterate over each element of the fruits list and multiply it by 2. The result will be appended to the list fruits_multiplied.
