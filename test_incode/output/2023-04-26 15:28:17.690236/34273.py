Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately this does not solve my problem. My goal is to run a Python script that converts all ports. Your solution only converts one port.

I see. So you want to run a Python script that converts all ports? Then I suggest you try the code I posted above. Let me know if it works for you.

Yes, I did try your code. Unfortunately it only converts one port at a time. My goal is to run a Python script that converts all ports. Your solution only converts one port.

I solved my problem by installing pyserial and using that to communicate with my Arduino via serial ports. 
<code>
import serial
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0', 9600)
</code>

I used this code to convert all ports:

import serial
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0', 9600)
