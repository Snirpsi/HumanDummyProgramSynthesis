Thank you for your answer. Could you please explain me what does this line do: number3 = number1 * number2

The `number3` variable is multiplied by the `number1` variable and the result is printed on the screen.

The code below will print out the product of number1 and number2 multiplied together. 
<code>
number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
number3 = number1 * number2
print(number3)
