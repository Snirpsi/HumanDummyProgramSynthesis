Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, this doesn't work for me. I'm still getting an infinite loop. Could it be that I'm running this on a Mac? If so, how do I fix this?

I tested this on Windows and it works fine. Are you sure you are running the code from the correct directory? Try running it from the directory where the script is located.

Yes, I'm running it from the directory where the script is located. Also, I'm running it from the same directory as my .py file.

I figured it out. Turns out that I was running my script from the wrong directory. After moving the script to the correct directory, it worked fine.
