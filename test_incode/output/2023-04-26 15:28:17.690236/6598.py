Thanks for your answer. Can you explain what does "fruit" stand for?

`fruit` is the variable that holds the user's input. `if fruit == "apple"` checks if the fruit variable equals "apple". If it does, it prints out the message. If it doesn't, it prints out the error message. `if fruit == "banana"` checks if the fruit variable equals "banana". If it does, it prints out the message. If it doesn't, it prints out the error message. `if fruit == "cherry"` checks if the fruit variable equals "cherry". If it does, it prints out the message. If it doesn't, it prints out the error message. `else:` prints out the error message if the fruit variable doesn't equal "apple", "banana" or "cherry".
